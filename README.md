# NotesApp
A location based notes application 

**App Descreption**  
  
The **“NotesPlace”** application is a location-based notes application.  
The app allows a user to add, edit and delete a note to a real time location,  
after the user has signed up and logged in.   
  
When the user signs into the app, he/she is greeted with the full name.   
The user has the option to click the “remember me” option and stay logged in.  
  
In order to delete a note, the user needs to hold and press on the selected note and click delete,  
 otherwise the data will be saved with any change.   
The user also has the option to log out.  
  
 In addition, the note list shows the notes sorted by date,   
 this was done by implementing note comparator.
